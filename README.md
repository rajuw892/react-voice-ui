# React Voice UI

React Voice UI is a lightweight hook-based library that enables voice commands in React applications.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-voice-ui
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { useVoiceCommands } from "react-voice-ui";

const App = () => {
  const { registerCommand } = useVoiceCommands();

  registerCommand("open menu", () => console.log("Opening menu"));

  return <div>Try saying "Open Menu"</div>;
};
```

## Features

- Register custom voice commands
- Start and stop voice recognition
- Text-to-Speech feedback

## Motivation Behind This

### ❌ The Problem:
- React apps lack built-in voice control 🚫
- Users must click to interact; no hands-free control 👎
- Implementing Web Speech API is hard for developers 😫

### ✅ The Solution:
- A lightweight React Hook for voice commands 🎙️
- Easily register commands ("Open menu", "Scroll down")
- Works in Chrome, supports multiple languages, and allows custom actions 🚀

## 🎯 Vision for react-voice-ui

Your goal is to:
- Make voice control as easy as `useState()` 🎯
- Enable hands-free interactions for users 🙌
- Build AI-powered voice understanding (NLP) 🔥
- Help developers add voice features in seconds 🛠️

### 💡 Imagine a world where users can say:

- "Go to Profile" → Navigates to Profile
- "Scroll Down" → Scrolls the page
- "Play Music" → Plays a song

🔥 `react-voice-ui` makes this possible in just a few lines of code!
