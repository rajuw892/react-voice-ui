# React Voice UI

React Voice UI is a lightweight hook-based library that enables voice commands in React applications.

## Installation
```sh
npm install react-voice-ui
```

## Usage
```tsx
import { useVoiceCommands } from "react-voice-ui";

const App = () => {
  const { registerCommand } = useVoiceCommands();

  registerCommand("open menu", () => console.log("Opening menu"));

  return <div>Try saying "Open Menu"</div>;
};
```

## Features
- Register custom voice commands
- Start and stop voice recognition
- Text-to-Speech feedback

Motivation Behind This
❌ Problem:
React apps lack built-in voice control 🚫
Users must click to interact; no hands-free control 👎
Implementing Web Speech API is hard for developers 😫
✅ Your Solution:

A lightweight React Hook for voice commands 🎙️
Easily register commands ("Open menu", "Scroll down")
Works in Chrome, multi-language, and custom actions 🚀
🎯 Your Vision for react-voice-ui

Your goal is to:
Make voice control as easy as useState() 🎯
Enable hands-free interactions for users 🙌
Build AI-powered voice understanding (NLP) 🔥
Help developers add voice features in seconds 🛠️
💡 Imagine a world where users can say:

"Go to Profile" → Navigates to Profile
"Scroll Down" → Scrolls the page
"Play Music" → Plays a song
🔥 react-voice-ui makes this possible in just a few lines of code!
